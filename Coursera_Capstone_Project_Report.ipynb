This System can be adapted to any province or for that matter any country in the world as  long as we have Geo-locational data available.** In this case we have incorporated data pertaining to Utilities, Hospitals, Educational Institutions, Restaurants etc. to suggest the best neighborhood, but this sytem is scalable and can be changed as per specific needs.The system will cluster neighborhoods based on available ameneties and suggest the best cluster. This is better, since individual is provided with information about multiple neighborhoods which are similar in terms of available ameneties. He can knitpick what's important for him and choose the location that suits him the best.\n\n**The Recommender System will be of tremendous help to any potential immigrant planning to migrate to any corner of the world, as he would have a first hand detailed information about the place he is going even before being there.**",

            "source": "To build the recommender sysytem, the first thing we need is the data containing the geographical coordinates of the boroughs and the neighborhoods within them. In our case it was data pertaining to Toronto and it's neighborhood. We specifically selected only East Toronto, West Toronto, Central Toronto and Downtown Toronto.We identified the neighborhoods within these boroughs using postal codes and got the geo - coordinates for them. We got the postal code information about Toronto and it's neighborhoods from a Wikipedia page 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M'.  We used a geospatial data which contains the geographical coordinates of these postal codes. We can take the help of tool also to get these coordinates. So once we have this data, the next step is to get the information pertaining to the amenities available in these neighborhoods. For that we took the help of  \"**Four Square**\" location data. ***Foursquare is a local search-and-discovery service mobile app which provides search results for its users.***\n\nWe used the Four Square APIs to explore the neighborhoods of Toronto.We used the **explore** function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood and **search** function to get information pertaining to specific amenities, for eg : Hospitals, Schools etc. available in each neighborhoods. Once we have Information pertaining to popular venues in each neighborhood, their category etc, we categorize them into subheads like \"Food and Dine\", \"Stores /Utilities\" etc. With Four Square search query we can get information pertaining to specific amenities, i.e if we want to know the details of \"schools and educational institutions\" in each neighborhood or if we want to know the details of \"Hospitals\" in each neighborhood etc.\n\nWe use this refined data as a starting point for our analysis.\n\n**Example of the Neighborhood data got from the Wikepedia page**\n\n|  Postcode  |  Borough        |  Neighborhood      |\n|------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n|  M4E       |  East Toronto   |   The Beaches      |\n\n**Example of the Geo spatial data** \n\n| Postcode   |  Latitude       | Longitude   |\n|------------|-----------------|-------------|\n|   M4E      |   43.676357     | -79.293031  |\n\n**Example from a Four Square Explore API, converted to a dataFrame**\n\n| Neighbourhood  |Neighbourhood Latitude|Neighbhourhood Longitude|Venue            | Venue Latitude   |  Venue Longitude  | Venue Category   |\n|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n|  The Beaches   |     43.676357        |     -79.293031         |Beaches Bake shop|      43.680363   | -79.289692        |   Bakery         |\n\n",

For our analysis we considered only \u201cCentral Toronto\u201d, \u201cEast Toronto\u201d, \u201cWest Toronto\u201d and \u201cDowntown Toronto\u201d.\n\n1. We scraped the Wikipedia page and wrangled the data, cleaned it, and then read it into a panda\u2019s data frame.We then acquired the latitudes and longitudes for these neighbourhoods in Toronto from the https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data.\n\n2. Once we have the list of neighbourhoods and their geographical coordinates, the next step in the analysis was to obtain amenities in each neighbourhood. For that we used Four Square api\u2019s to gather information about the venues in each neighbourhood.\n\n      - First, we used Four Square \u2018explore\u2019 query to get the information about different venues and venue categories with in 1000 meter of each neighbourhood.\n\n      - We then assigned General Categories such as \"Food and Dine\", \"Arts and Entertainment\", \"Stores and Utilities\" etc to all the Venue categories by grouping the similar venue categories.\n\n      - We then once again used the Four Square api to get specific information pertaining to \u201cSchools\u201d and \u201cHospitals\u201d. Four that we used the \u2018search\u2019 query. We categorised that as \u201cEducational\u201d and \u201cHospitals\u201d.\n\n\n3. Once we had all the required data, we did a one-hot encoding of the categories column and summarised it based on the neighbourhoods. Now our data is ready for Segmentation.\n\n4. We used k-means clustering to segment our neighbourhoods into 5 clusters.  We then added the cluster labels back to the data.\n\n5. After performing the clustering, we then focus on the cluster centres. The Group whose centre has the highest amenities (from Total Facilities) will be the suggested for \u201cthe Best neighbourhood\u201d.",

In this connected world where people are moving and migrating more than ever,any system or method that can provide simple and effective solution in dispelling the uncertainity related to lack of knowledge about proposed place and surrounding neighborhoods will be an effective tool to have before making the move. As mentioned above we have taken Toronto as an example in this case study, but the Recommender system can be implemented across geographies as long as we have the required Geo-locational data available. The locational data provided by the locational data providers like Four Square, Google Places etc. can help us fine tune and adapt the system to granular level of information that we need, to cater to our specific needs.",
