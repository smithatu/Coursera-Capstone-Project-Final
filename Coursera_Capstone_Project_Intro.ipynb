This System can be adapted to any province or for that matter any country in the world as  long as we have Geo-locational data available.** In this case we have incorporated data pertaining to Utilities, Hospitals, Educational Institutions, Restaurants etc. to suggest the best neighborhood, but this sytem is scalable and can be changed as per specific needs.The system will cluster neighborhoods based on available ameneties and suggest the best cluster. This is better, since individual is provided with information about multiple neighborhoods which are similar in terms of available ameneties. He can knitpick what's important for him and choose the location that suits him the best.\n\n**The Recommender System will be of tremendous help to any potential immigrant planning to migrate to any corner of the world, as he would have a first hand detailed information about the place he is going even before being there.**",
